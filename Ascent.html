				10 years after First Light in the Italian city of Venice, an agent of Omega made the journey across worlds to plant and detonate a spike. 
				With the VALORANT Protocol failing to stop them, the resulting explosion triggered a cataclysmic event, ripping a huge chunk of the city out of the ground. Now permanently suspended hundreds of meters in the sky, this airborne island remains as a product of the most destructive radianite-related event known to Alpha.

				This is valorant's first map released after beta and it only has 2 sites.
				Both A and B site have a decent amount of cover to use while attacking or defending.
				The unique thing about this map is that it has closeable doors on both sites that can be destroyed.
				The doors are controlled by a lever, one is on B site at the shed and the other is on A site next to the door itself.
				The middle has a lot of open area and many places to shoot from making it harder to navigate if populated by an enemy team.
