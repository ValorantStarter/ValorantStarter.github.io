	Built in the American canyons of New Mexico, the Everett-Linde Research Facility was a top-secret collaboration between the Kingdom organizations of Alpha and Omega. 
	Their mission to construct a Large Radian Collider and its surrounding projects were ground-breaking in their scientific fields. 
	But on the day of what would have been the collider's launch, so came its end instead; the collider destroyed by two snipers and a resulting explosion that wiped out most of the lab's staff. 
	Now, the abandoned husk of the facility is all that remains of a lost hope to improve the state of both worlds.

			    Fracture is one of the newer maps that came out in september 2021. 
			    This map also uses ropes but takes some of them to the next level.
			    They have ropes for both A and B site but they also have it in the middle of the map.
			    On the attacking side you can choose to use the rope to either go from the front or back of the site.
			    Once the round starts the defenders will also be allowed to use the rope.
			    They also have hidden info cards in two areas of the map with little bios about agents or different people involved in the lore.
