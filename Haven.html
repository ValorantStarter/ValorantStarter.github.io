				In Bhutan's capital city of Thimphu, a temple is subjected to the latest developments facing a modern Earth in the era of radianite. 
				As parts of it crumble and burn due to a radianite-related event causing masses of large columns to erupt from the ground, the global reach of Kingdom Corporation has also arrived there, taking over the site to use it as storage for their radianite crates.

				This map came out during the beta along with 2 other maps. 
				This is one of the only maps with 3 sites one on the left, right and middle.
				On A site there is a giant box to use for cover but everything else is open.
				They also have a tower to look down on most of the site from above.
				On B site it is a close quarters area in the middle of the map.
				C site is the most open part of the map making it easier to take fights.
