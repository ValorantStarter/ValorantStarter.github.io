				Far up north among the Russian islands of the Arctic Ocean lies a Kingdom Corporation container port and research facility. 
				Excavating the remains of an ancient warship that had appeared to be trapped within the ice, further studies reveal there may be more to the ship and its crew than previously expected, revelations that have attracted the attention of others to the otherwise secret site.

				Icebox is the 5th map to come out from valorant, its release date was in October 17th, 2022.
				This map again has 2 sites with A site having a more closed off area.
				There are many boxes around the site for cover and they even have ziplines to get to different spots easier.
				On B site it is an open area with only a middle area to use for cover along with a giant yellow crate.
				In the middle area there is also a zipline with a giant opening to see the enemies on the site.
