			The Pearl District geo-dome is one of several to exist on the Portuguese coast of Omega Earth. 
			As the state of Omega's climate verges on the brink of collapse, the city of Lisbon faced destructive rising tides on course to completely submerge it below the ocean.
			To save the city and its people, the VALORANT Legion and Kingdom Industries worked together to keep the tides at bay and construct the geo-domes.
			Though the Atlantic inevitably rose far above, the completion of the geo-domes has ensured parts of Lisbon have still survived and its people can continue life beneath the waves.

			<p>
			Pearl was a newer map in valorant since it was released in September 22,2022.
			It has two sites that are very opposite in the way they are set up.
			On B site there is a long corridor from the attackers side to enter the site.
			However on A site it is more close quarters and has multiple objects to use for cover.
			In between A and B site for the defender side there is a small opening to go between the middle and spawn.
