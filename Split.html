		Within the Shinjuku district of Japan's capital, Tokyo, a split has emerged between two groups. 
		On one side, Kingdom Corporation continues its developments in the area, building plazas alongside its offices and shops there, and all overlooked by its humongous HQ situated further north, towering into the city skyline. 
		On the other side, local residents not only push back against the corporation's expansion into their home and removal of their cultural property, but seek to take it back from them.

			This was another map released during the beta and was recently put back in rotation.
			The special part about this map is the new area in the middle of the map.
			There is a enclosed area to go from B site to A site easily by using two ropes to go up and down.
			This was the first map where ropes appeared and were very useful. 
			You can see one on B site and another going to the sewer area.
			The sewer area is close to the attacker entrance for A site which can be used to go to the middle of the map.
