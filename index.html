				Map Info
			</h2>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">
		    <font size="-1">
				There are multiple different maps in Valorant and they all have unique details.
				Some are set in towns while others are in a dome surrounded by water. 
				Every map has at least two sites known as A and B site. 
				Those are considered your objective where depending the side you're on you attack or defense.
				Both teams start on the opposite sides of the map and get about 30 seconds of the buy phase where you can get all your abilites and weapons. 
				The current maps that you can play are Bind,Haven,Pearl,Fracture,Icebox,Breeze,Ascent. 
				The only map with 3 sites is haven and it's still the same concept as every other map except you need to cover more area.

                <font size="-1">
			There are many different places to aim train but the most reliable and popular ones are the valorant range and aim labs.
			You will be able to access the range in the menu before you queue up for a game to get yourself warmed up.
			There are 3 different modes of difficulty which changes the speed of the bots dissapearing. 
			There is then the sheild option whether to give them more health for extra realism, along with that you can choose if a bot strafes and if your number of kills you need to complete the training. 
			While in the range you may practice defusing and planting. 
			The second option is aim labs which can be downloaded on steam and is completely free to start. 
			In this app there are various training option for pretty much any shooter game. 
			There are even recommended playlists which are a bunch of different versions of training made by famous youtubers and streamers.
			After you finish and session of training it reviews your stats and what you need to work on.

				Pricing
			</h2>
			<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">
			    <font size="-1">
			There are 5 different teirs in pricing for valorant that included the Select edition,Deluxe edition,Premium edition,Ultra edition and Exclusive edition.
			Different skins also have different upgrades to them making them look collor by adding auras or bullet tracers.
			If you have a high rarity weapon you will also be able to upgrade it to having a kill effect when you get the last enemy. 
			The lower editions such as select and deluxe won't allow you to upgrade it at all but it will still look cool.
			When bundles come out you will be able to buy 5 different weapon skins and a melee weapon in a pack. 
			Although the pack will be more expensive then getting a singular gun it is better than buying all the skins in the bundle seperatly. 
			You will actually save money on the melee skin if you get the bundle. 
			The valorant shop switches every 24 hours and it switches at 8:00 pm EST, the last part to the shop which only happens once in a while is the night market. 
			This is where the game randomly selects 6 different skins of any rarity and puts them on sale.
